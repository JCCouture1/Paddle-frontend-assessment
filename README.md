1) this application was built with React  JS


And the dependencies used in implementing this applications are as follows
i) Axios
ii)Material UI Icons
iii) react-router-dom@6
iv) installed bootstrap but was never used 


1ii) This is a METRICKS web responsive application, on the nav there are some navigation routes that takes you to the navigation and the information you would liked to get.
i also added the github route on the nav bar, i did so because i was cleared on whether I'm to create a different web app for it or just implement it here.
and also about the github api, i was having a little issue trying to fetch information from the API, i had to use POSTMAN which if i insert the API i would see the details but when i try to implement it I'm not getting my desired results so i just had to use the users API.

2) i just had to make some little changes with the background image and also on the footer, and also made the nav to be responsive
